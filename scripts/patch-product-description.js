/**
 * Storefront product page: the part's DESCRIPTION is shown right under the name and the part chips (before the stock box, seller lines, price and buy button), and it STAYS as the last row of the Technical Specifications card too.
 * A part with no description shows nothing under the name. Run it AFTER scripts/patch-product-parity.js (it uses the layout of the column beside the photos from that patch).
 *
 *   node scripts/patch-product-description.js            dry run: says what it would change, writes nothing
 *   node scripts/patch-product-description.js --write    applies it (the changed file is saved as <file>.before-product-description first)
 *
 * A file that is not exactly what the patch expects is NOT changed. Running it twice is harmless ("already").
