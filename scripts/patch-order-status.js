/**
 * SERVER: the status the buyer's order LIST and order page show (displayStatus) can now be "cancelled". It never could: a cancelled order has no shipment, so it fell through to "to_ship" and showed as "To ship" in the list on the website and in the app
 * (and was counted in "Active shipments"). An order is cancelled when its own status is cancelled OR every one of its parts is. Admin sees it too. No migration. Restart the backend afterwards.
 *
 *   node scripts/patch-order-status.js            dry run: says what it would change, writes nothing
 *   node scripts/patch-order-status.js --write    applies it (the changed file is saved as <file>.before-order-status first)
 *
 * A file that is not exactly what the patch expects is NOT changed (the whole patch stops, so nothing is half applied). Running it twice is harmless ("already").
